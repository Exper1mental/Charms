# Charms
Charms is a Rainmeter sidebar skin based on the Charms bar from Windows 8 and 8.1.

## Notes
This is a work-in-progress, not an official release. When it is ready, the official release will be posted on my DeviantART.

Requirements
 - Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 or 10
 - Rainmeter 3.3.1 or newer
 - FrostedGlass plugin installed (get it on the Rainmeter.net forums)

Recommended
 - SpotifyPlugin if you use Spotify (get it on the Rainmeter.net forums)

My Charms skin is a bit different from most Rainmeter skins so I thought I'd briefly touch on how it is setup to work. In the Charms subfolder the skin "Charms.ini" is what I use to activate the rest of the skin. This skin is "invisible" but will activate "CharmsMenu.ini" in the CharmsMenu subfolder if you move you're mouse to the upper-right-hand corner or lower-right-hand corner of you're primary monitor. (this may not work if you have another skin or window covering that portion of the screen)

The variables.inc should have all the variables you'd want to modify. It has some (unfinished) documentation included with it to make manual editing easier.

If you try using Locate32 you need to refresh the database by clicking the refresh circle before searching for the first time (and let Locate32 finish before searching. Eventually my plan is for the skin to tell you when Locate32 is done building or refreshing its database). Locate32 does not automatically update it's database the way it is setup so when you want to search or find some new folder you'll need to refresh the database again.


There is also a "hidden" update skin. You can currently use this skin to check for the latest beta and final releases of Rainmeter (Charms update checker doesn't do anything for now).

Feel free to contact me if you have any critiques, suggestions, questions, or issues. ;)
